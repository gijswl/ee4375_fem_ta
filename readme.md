# EE4375 - Finite Element Modelling (2022/2023)
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with Julia and Python code for the course EE4375.
It serves as my own repository for the development of several extensions to the course material, as outlined in the official course repository (https://github.com/ziolai/finite_element_electrical_engineering).

As the development progresses, this readme and the notebooks in the repository will be extended.
