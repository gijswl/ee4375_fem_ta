    "## Multiple Dispatch\n",
    "Multiple dispatch is a fundamental paradigm of the Julia programming language. It is the selection of a function implementation based on the (_dynamic_) types of each argument of the function. It is not only a nice notation to remove a long list of “case” statements, but it is part of the reason for Julia’s speed.\n",
    "You can read more about multiple dispatch in general, and its implementation in Julia here:\n",
    " - Julia: A fresh approach to numerical computing ([arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1607.pdf))\n",
    " - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch)\n",
    " - The Julia documentation on [Methods](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/)\n",
    " - [Video \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch\" by Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other flavours of dispatch are:\n",
    "- Static single dispatch: not implemented in practice.\n",
    "- Static multiple dispatch: this implementation is common in statically typed languages (e.g., overloading in C++).\n",
    "- Dynamic single dispatch: in languages like MATLAB and Python.\n",
    "- Dynamic multiple dispatch: this is the implementation in Julia, typically referred to as \"multiple dispatch\"."

    "Lazy evaluation is the cornerstone of many functional programming languages. The key concept is as follows: when an operation such as a functional call is performed, we do not evaluate the result immediately (that would be _eager_ evaluation). Instead, the operation is postponed until the result is actually necessary, i.e., it is evaluated _lazily_.\n",

    "### Laziness in ``Gridap.jl``\n",
    "Laziness is used extensively in ``Gridap.jl``, and is the one of the reasons for its excellent performance. Lazy arrays play a fundamental role in the implementation of the finite element method in Gridap (how it works is explained in https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t013_poisson_dev_fe/).\n",
    "A large amount of code is devoted to lazy operations in Gridap, mostly centered around the ``lazy_map`` function. It creates a ``LazyArray`` that conceptually applies the mapping function to an array, but does not actually execute this until it is necessary. Large and complex 'compound' operations are built in this way. Eventually, the mapping may be evaluated at a set of points using evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy objects constructed in this way provide the following advantages in Gridap:\n",
    " - Memory allocation (and consumption) is kept at very low levels, since ``lazy_map`` will never return an array that stores the result at all cells at once.\n",
    " - Computation can be done in an efficient way (e.g., using cache to store the entry-wise data without the need to allocate memory each time we access the ``LazyArray``).\n",
    " - The recursive application of ``lazy_map`` lets us build complex operation trees among arrays of ``Maps`` as the ones required for the implementation of variational forms. While building these trees, by virtue of Julia support for multiple type dispatching, there are plenty of opportunities for optimization by changing the order in which the operations are performed.\n",
    " - Using ``lazy_map`` we are hiding thousands of cell loops across the code. As a result, Gridap is much more expressive for cell-wise implementations.\n",
    " - ``lazy_map`` allows for very expressive code that reads much like the original mathematical formulation both internally (e.g., in pretty much every aspect of low-level Gridap code) and externally (e.g., the definition of the variational form, shown below)."
